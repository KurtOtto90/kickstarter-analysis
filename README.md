### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 There could be confusion since the two graph are not for the same information.  Outcomes by Launch date is for Theater campaigns, while outcomes based on Goals is for all.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
For the highest chance of success the campaign should be started in May. 
Those that start at the end of the year have the least chance of success.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The higher the goal amount the less chance that Louise will be successful.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The is a data set mismatch in the two graphs that one is for only theater data and the other is for all data.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Graphing the number of campaigns and outcomes as most campaigns are below $15,000
